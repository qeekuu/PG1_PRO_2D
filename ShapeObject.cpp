/**

 * This file currently serves as a placeholder for the implementation of the
 * ShapeObject class. The ShapeObject class acts as a bridge between DrawableObject
 * and TransformableObject, enabling derived classes to inherit both drawing
 * and transformation capabilities.

 // No additional implementation is required for ShapeObject as it serves 
 // as an interface combining DrawableObject and TransformableObject.
